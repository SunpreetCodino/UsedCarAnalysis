## Used Cars Analysis
This is a large dataset that contains information on ~30000+ vehicles, with data including; manufacturer, colours, body type, production year and more.
For the process of data cleaning, analysis and visualisation I used Python via Jupytper to make my code and analysis easy to read and follow. 

I decided not to include an Excel file for this dataset, as using Microsoft Excel for large datasets isn't as efficient as Python for data cleaning and analysis.
For other projects, I may have included an Excel file to present my ability to use various tools to analyse data. Here, I decided that using Excel is inappropriate - relative to the large size of the dataset.
